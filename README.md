The project titled "Leaderboard Points System" is a full-stack web application that allows users to claim random points (between 1 and 10), view a real-time dynamic leaderboard, and track their claim history. Users can also be added dynamically from the frontend. The application is built using React for the frontend, deployed on Vercel, and Node.js with MongoDB Atlas for the backend and data storage. The system includes APIs for adding users, claiming points, and fetching ranking data. The MongoDB database stores user information and the complete history of point claims.
